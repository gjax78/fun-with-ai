# Fun with AI ðŸ¤–

Whether youâ€™re looking for a friendly chat, studying for an exam, or learning a new language, [Fun with AI](https://fun-with-ai-gjax78.herokuapp.com/) is a simple-to-use application that will help you unlock intellectual potential and may even strengthen your cognitive abilities.

There are a few friends to collaborate with, each a little unique:

1. Davinci - The most capable AI. He will help you reach your highest potential.
2. Curie - Faster than Davinci, but not quite as capable. She's still learning!
3. Babbage - Very straightforward and very fast.
4. Ada - A simple gal, but very speedy!
    - If you're having trouble deciding, give Curie a try. 
    
After choosing your friend, put their knowledge to the test by typing a phrase of your choice in the text area (suggested prompts will be loaded for you after you choose your AI, but feel free to create your own as well). Have fun!
